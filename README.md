# OO code using turtle graphics
- From the starting code, polygon_art.py, you are to write an OO program that generates different pieces of art works
- Fork, then, clone this repo
- Read the instructions given in the course's Google Classroom and start coding
- Once you are done, push your final code to your Github repo and modify this README to report on the work you have done

Classes:    Polygon: Represent a non-embedded shape, responsible for drawing and location of the shape.
            PolygonArt: Responsible for setting up parameter for the shape, location, size, color, etc.
            EmbeddedPolygon: Represent an embedded shape, responsible for drawing and location of the embedded-shape.

Method:     Clone this project
            Open this project in your preferred IDE
            **For IDE's interpreter is needed to be python version 3.X**
            **Need Turtle Library to compiling**
            Run the program
            Select number between 1-9 in the terminal(1 for triangle, 2 for quadrillateral, 3 for pentagon, 4 for mixing between 1-3, 5 for embedded triangle, 6 for embedded quadrillateralm 7 for embedded pentagon, 8 for mixing between 5-7, 9 for mixing 4 and 8)
